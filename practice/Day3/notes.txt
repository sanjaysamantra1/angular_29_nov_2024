variables are containers for storing data values.

variable name is the location address where it was assigned

can be declared using below 3 keywords: let, var, const

when assigned with var and let keywords variables values can be modified.
variables assigned with const keyword can't be changed and value must be decalred at the time of initialization.

variables declared with let and const cannot be redeclared.

variables declared with let and const have scopes ranging from block / function / global

var keyword assigned variables have function / global scopes

A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible
until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value. 

In JavaScript, the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the period between entering a scope and the actual declaration of a variable within that scope. During this phase, the variable exists but is inaccessible. It's a behavior specific to let and const declarations, introduced in ES6.
